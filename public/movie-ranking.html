<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Coach Carter</h3>
<p>This is my favorite basketball movie. I love the influence the coach has on his students apart from basketball.</p>
<h3>Planet of the Apes</h3>
<p>The original one. I was shocked by the reveal at the end of the movie.</p>
<h3>Megamind</h3>
<p>Best underrated animated film with a moving message. Just wish Metroman stayed dead.</p>
