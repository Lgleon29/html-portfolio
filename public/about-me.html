<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Business and Finances student at Esan College. On my free time I enjoy reading light novels and playing video games.</p>

<p>I was always interested in Computer Science and programming but was intimidated by it but regretted not learning it, especially during my teens.</p>

<p>Hopefully with this course I will be able to quench a little of that regret at 24 years(almost 25).</p>
